Microsoft Sound Access

Microsoft introduced "Windows Core Audio" and "Media Foundation" with
Vista.  Core Audio is a low level API useful for pro audio apps.  Most
sound apps would use either Direct Sound or Media Foundation; these use
Core Audio for sound card access.

Microsoft does not plan to make Core Audio available for Windows XP.
Media Foundation requires Windows Vista or later.

The ASIO driver by Steinberg provides low latency access to the
sound card, but requires an ASIO driver on the PC.  See
