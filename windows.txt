Windows USB Driver
==================
You don't need to install a USB driver unless your hardware is controlled
by USB. If you have recent SoftRock hardware controlled by USB, you must install
a USB driver.  Quisk uses the same driver as other SoftRock programs, namely
the PE0FKO driver package.  This driver is based on libusb-win32, which in turn
is based on libusb-0.1.

A newer version of libusb called libusb-1.0 will soon be available, and the SoftRock
community may start using the newer software and a newer driver.  Quisk will always
follow any changes the SoftRock community makes, so just install whatever libusb
driver is most current.  If it doesn't work with Quisk, I will fix Quisk.
