# This is a sample quisk_conf.py configuration file for Linux
# For Windows, your default config file name is "/home/user/quisk_conf.py"
# but you can use a different config file by using -c or --config.  Quisk creates
# an initial default config file if there is none.  To control Quisk, edit
# "/home/user/quisk_conf.py" using any text editor; for example WordPad (not Notepad).
# In Windows you can see what sound devices you have, and you can set the Primary
# Device for capture and playback by using Control Panel/Sounds and Audio Devices.
# If you have only one sound device, it should be set as "Primary".  If you have
# several, find the names by using Control Panel/Sounds and Audio Devices; for
# example, you may have "SoundMAX HD Audio" in the list for "Sound playback" and
# "Sound recording".  To specify this device for capture (recording) or playback,
# enter a unique part of its name using exact upper/lower case.  For example:
#       name_of_sound_capture = "SoundMAX"
#       name_of_sound_play = "SoundMAX"
# There are many possible options for your config file.  Copy the ones you want
# from the master file quisk_conf_defaults.py (but don't change the master file).
# The master config file is located in the site-packages/quisk folder for Python 2.7.
# This file is Python code and the comment character is "#".  To ignore a line,
# start it with "#".  To un-ignore a line, remove the "#".  Generally you must start
# lines in column one (the left edge) except for logic blocks.
